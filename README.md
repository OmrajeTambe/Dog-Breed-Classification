üêï Dog Breed Classification using CNNs
Welcome to the Dog Breed Classification project! This repository contains the Jupyter notebook for a machine learning model that classifies images of dogs into their respective breeds using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The project aims to explore deep learning techniques in the context of image classification, specifically for identifying over 120 dog breeds from a dataset of labeled images.

üîç Project Overview
The primary goal of this project is to build a CNN model that can accurately classify dog breeds from images. The model leverages transfer learning to improve performance, speeding up training and enhancing accuracy. The project includes the following steps:

Data loading and preprocessing
Model building using transfer learning
Training, evaluation, and testing
Model performance visualization
üìä Dataset
The dataset used for this project consists of over 10,000 images representing 120+ distinct dog breeds. Each image is labeled with the breed name, making it a supervised learning problem. The dataset is split into training, validation, and test sets to evaluate the model‚Äôs performance accurately.

Key Statistics:
Total images: 10,000+
Dog breeds: 120+
Image size: Resized to 224x224 pixels for faster processing
üìö Model Architecture
The notebook employs Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) as the core model architecture, specifically utilizing transfer learning from pre-trained models (e.g., ResNet50, VGG16) to boost accuracy. By using transfer learning, the model benefits from patterns learned on large-scale datasets, reducing the time needed to converge and enhancing generalization.

Model Details:
Pre-trained models: ResNet50, VGG16 (others can be swapped in)
Optimizer: Adam
Loss function: Categorical crossentropy (due to multi-class classification)
Accuracy: Achieved ~85% on the validation/test set
üìà Training Process
The training process involves several stages:

Data Augmentation: Techniques such as rotation, flipping, and zooming to improve generalization.
Transfer Learning: Fine-tuning the pre-trained model on the dog breed dataset.
Evaluation: The model is evaluated using accuracy, loss metrics, and confusion matrices for a detailed performance review.
üõ†Ô∏è Tools and Libraries
The following tools and libraries are used in the project:

Python 3.x
TensorFlow/Keras: For building and training the CNN models
Matplotlib/Seaborn: For visualizing training metrics and results
